# CHANGELOG

## 2025-09-06

- 16:45: Added right-side AI Edit Panel (`src/components/edit/ai-edit-panel.tsx`) with collapsible design, preset prompts, custom prompt textarea (500 chars), real-time counter, strength slider (0.1‚Äì1.0), and response card.
- 16:45: Added vertical Thumbnail Gallery (`src/components/edit/thumbnail-gallery.tsx`) to display original try-on image and edit history as small thumbnails with selection and badges.
- 16:45: Implemented AI Response Card (`src/components/edit/ai-response-card.tsx`) to show prompt, strength, duration and model info with gradient style.
- 16:45: Integrated panel and gallery into Edit page (`src/app/edit/page.tsx`): added state management (`editHistory`, `selectedImageIndex`, `isAiPanelOpen`, `aiLastResponse`), auto-open panel after try-on, and full wiring.
- 16:45: Updated `ControlPanel` (`src/components/edit/control-panel.tsx`) to include an "AI D√ºzenle" button that opens the panel when a result exists.
- 16:45: Added API stub for AI editing at `src/app/api/nano-banana-edit/route.ts` returning simulated results and meta.
 - 16:56: Polished `AiEditPanel` to match provided design: gradient header icon, compact 2x2 quick actions, list-style preset items with emojis, disabled textarea when no image, percentage label for slider, Hafif/G√º√ßl√º labels, and sticky bottom action bar with primary gradient button.
 - 16:56: Refactored `ThumbnailGallery` to fixed 24-width sidebar equivalent (`w-24`) with "Ge√ßmi≈ü" header and list-style thumbnails (3:4 aspect), matching screenshot layout.
 - 16:59: Completely redesigned `AiEditPanel` to match exact UI from provided screenshot: gradient purple header background, colorful quick action cards with gradients, emoji-based preset list with gray backgrounds, custom slider styling with purple fill, and bottom action bar with "Send element" button.
 - 17:02: Removed "Send console errors" button from AI Edit Panel, simplified bottom action bar to show only the main "AI ile D√ºzenle" button at full width.
 - 17:03: Updated AI Edit Panel layout: changed button to purple-pink gradient, made preset prompts smaller (2x2 grid, 10px font), and made input area fixed at bottom to prevent page overflow.
 - 17:05: Removed AI Response Card (d√ºzenleme detaylarƒ±) from AI Edit Panel to simplify the interface - no more detail cards shown after editing.
 - 17:06: Fixed UI issues in AI Edit Panel: added safe area below button (pb-6) and fixed slider overflow issue where purple fill was appearing in front of the slider thumb by implementing proper z-index layering.
 - 17:07: Fixed TypeScript error in page.tsx by removing lastResponse prop from AiEditPanel component call (prop no longer exists after removing AI Response Card).
 - 17:08: Completely redesigned slider component with modern best practices: custom thumb with hover effects, purple gradient fill, percentage badge, visual indicators for Hafif/G√º√ßl√º labels, smooth animations, and improved accessibility.
 - 17:09: Complete AI Edit Panel optimization: fixed button positioning, compact layout (2-row textarea), single-column preset prompts, custom scrollbar, hover animations, modern button styling with lift effect, proper overflow handling, and responsive design improvements.

 - 18:30: Collapsible AI Edit Panel improvements: added right-edge toggle button to reopen panel when closed, persisted panel open state in localStorage, and introduced keyboard shortcuts (Esc to close, Ctrl/Cmd+E to toggle). Removed FAB to avoid overlay conflicts and white-space issues.

 - 18:38: Converted AI Edit Panel to absolute overlay (right:0, top:0) and added conditional right padding (`pr-[320px] md:pr-[380px]`) to the main content container to prevent overlap with the bottom control panel and gallery.

 - 18:52: Fixed double-inference bug in single garment flow by removing internal API call from `src/components/edit/clothing-panel.tsx` and delegating inference to parent `src/app/edit/page.tsx` only.
 - 18:52: Normalized `clothingType` (maps `single` ‚Üí `kƒ±yafet`) in `src/app/edit/page.tsx` and `src/app/api/nano-banana/route.ts` to prevent malformed prompts and improve model guidance.
 - 18:52: Added safe debug logging (base64 length metrics, flags) to `handleTryOnResult` and `nano-banana` API route for better observability without leaking image contents.

 - 18:59: Converted all try-on prompts to English and specialized by garment type: added separate prompts for upper-only, lower-only, dress, and retained multi-garment prompt. Normalized `clothingType` mapping (single‚Üíupper, dress aliases‚Üídress) in `src/app/api/nano-banana/route.ts`.

 - 19:02: Edit flow policy updated in `src/app/edit/page.tsx`: AI Edit requests now ALWAYS use the ORIGINAL try-on output as the base image when sending to `/api/nano-banana-edit`. New results are appended to history with a new sequential item and auto-selected.

 - 19:15: Enabled Enter-to-submit in AI Edit Panel textarea (`src/components/edit/ai-edit-panel.tsx`). Shift+Enter inserts a newline; Enter triggers submit.

 - 19:22: Unified Download behavior. Bottom control panel Download button now uses the same logic as the header and downloads the currently selected image (history item if selected, otherwise original try-on). Also added blob fallback for non-data URLs to ensure downloads work reliably (`src/app/edit/page.tsx`, `src/components/edit/control-panel.tsx`).

 - 19:23: UI polish in Clothing Panel: moved the plus icon to the LEFT of the "Tek Par√ßa Kƒ±yafet Ekle" text and adjusted paddings/gaps for better fit on narrow widths (`src/components/edit/clothing-panel.tsx`).

 - 19:29: Refactored Try-On trigger flow. Removed per-item "AI ile Dene" button under uploaded items and introduced a fixed bottom-left main button in `ControlPanel` that becomes enabled when a try-on trigger is available (uploaded single item selected, or both upper+lower provided). Wiring done via `registerTryOnTrigger` from `ClothingPanel` ‚Üí `EditPage` ‚Üí `ControlPanel`. Files: `src/components/edit/clothing-panel.tsx`, `src/app/edit/page.tsx`, `src/components/edit/control-panel.tsx`.

 - 21:37: Successfully installed all project dependencies via npm install. Resolved npm cache permission issues and installed 463 packages with 0 vulnerabilities. All dependencies from package.json are now available including Next.js 14.2.32, React 18.3.1, TypeScript 5.9.2, and AI/ML libraries (@google/genai, @runwayml/sdk, replicate).

 - 21:40: Created `.env.local` and populated required environment variables with placeholders. Keys: `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, `GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY`, `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`, `RUNWAYML_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `STABILITY_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET`, `MAX_FILE_SIZE`, `API_RATE_LIMIT`. Notes: `.env*.local` is git-ignored; fill real secrets locally and rotate keys if exposed.

 - 21:49: Added horizontal bottom history gallery for small screens and limited vertical gallery to md+ only. Implemented `HorizontalThumbnailGallery` (`src/components/edit/horizontal-thumbnail-gallery.tsx`) and integrated it in `src/app/edit/page.tsx` below `ModelViewer` (visible on `md:hidden`). Vertical `ThumbnailGallery` now wrapped with `hidden md:block`. Spacer for AI panel reservation is also limited to md+ (`hidden md:block`).

 - 21:56: Next.js config updated for v14 App Router best practices. Removed deprecated `experimental.appDir` and top-level `api` options, migrated `images.domains` to `images.remotePatterns`, kept `images.formats` and `compiler.removeConsole`. File: `next.config.js`. Note: Dev server restart may be required to clear warnings.

 - 21:58: Removed deprecated `@next/font` from dependencies in `package.json`. Project search shows no code importing `@next/font`, so codemod is unnecessary for now. Action required: reinstall packages and restart the dev server to clear the warning.

 - 22:16: Layout iyile≈ütirmesi: Ge√ßmi≈ü b√∂l√ºm√º (ThumbnailGallery) AI panelinin arkasƒ±nda kalma sorununu √ß√∂zmek i√ßin saƒü sidebar'ƒ±n saƒüƒ±na ta≈üƒ±ndƒ±. Artƒ±k layout ≈üu ≈üekilde: Sol Panel (320px) | Model Viewer | AI Panel (320-380px) | Thumbnail Gallery (80-96px). Bu sayede AI paneli a√ßƒ±k olduƒüunda da ge√ßmi≈ü b√∂l√ºm√º g√∂r√ºn√ºr kalƒ±yor.
 - 22:16: ThumbnailGallery responsive iyile≈ütirmeleri: K√º√ß√ºk ekranlarda geni≈ülik 80px'e d√º≈ü√ºr√ºld√º (md+ 96px), ba≈ülƒ±k k√º√ß√ºk ekranlarda emoji (üì∑) olarak g√∂steriliyor, padding deƒüerleri responsive hale getirildi.
